### Immediate To-Do List (in correct order)

To avoid being overwhelmed, follow this order:

1. Load dataset + implement baseline LR & CNN models
2. Extract feature vectors
3. Implement geometry-aware clipping (3 methods)
4. Implement Laplace LDP and generate first utility curves
5. Implement bout detection + shuffling + pseudonym rotation + timestamp perturbation
6. Run unlinkability attack models and compute AUC
7. Run combined pipeline
8. Perform ablations
9. Measure overhead
10. Assemble plots + write paper

This is the fastest possible path to a full mini-paper.
